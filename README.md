# Git Practice Workflows

This repository is a sandbox for practicing essential Git commands and workflows: branching, committing, merging, and resolving merge conflicts.

## What I practice here

- Initializing a repository and creating commits.
- Creating and working on feature branches.
- Merging branches back into `main`.
- Creating and resolving simple merge conflicts.

## Why this repo exists

This is not an application, it is a learning lab to keep my Git basics sharp and to show my comfort with everyday Git workflows used in real projects.
