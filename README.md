# Git Practice Workflows

This repository demonstrates my comfort with essential Git workflows: branching, committing, merging, and resolving merge conflicts. Used as a hands-on sandbox to keep Git commands as muscle memory for real projects like [AWS Nginx Reverse Proxy](https://github.com/subba-dev-ops/aws-nginx-reverse-proxy-lb).

## What I practiced here

- Creating and switching between branches (`git checkout -b`, `git checkout`)
- Making commits on feature branches
- Merging feature branches into `main`
- Resolving simple merge conflicts

## Git history walkthrough

See the commit history and branches to trace my practice workflow:

1. **Initial commit** → base files created
2. **`feature/update-notes`** → expanded notes.txt on a feature branch → merged to main
3. **`feature/conflict-example`** → intentionally created a conflict → resolved and merged
