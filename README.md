# Git Practice Workflows

This repository is a sandbox for practicing essential Git commands and workflows: branching, committing, merging, and resolving merge conflicts.

## What I practice here

- Initializing a repository and creating commits.
- Creating and working on feature branches.
- Merging branches back into `main`.
- Creating and resolving simple merge conflicts.

Typical flow:

1. Start from `main`.
2. Create a new feature branch.
3. Make and commit changes.
4. Merge the feature branch back into `main`.
5. Occasionally create intentional conflicts to practice conflict resolution.


## Why this repo exists

This is not an application, it is a learning lab to keep my Git basics sharp and to show my comfort with everyday Git workflows used in real projects.
